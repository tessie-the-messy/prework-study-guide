# <Prework Study Guide Web App>

## Description
The goal of this web app is to give students a TL;DR version of the Bootcamp Prework to refer to when in need of a refresher. Staging the study guide into a web app provides a hands-on way to study the content. Not only is the information displayed in order to be read, but it's embedded into the web app itself. It's basically meta. This project also should help students see why JavaScript is their new nemesis.
